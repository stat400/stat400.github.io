<h2 id = "Exam-FAQ"> Exam FAQ </h2>

Q: How many exams are there?
: A: There are three midterms and one final exam.

Q: How much are our exams worth?
: A: The midterms are each 50 points. The final exam is 100 points. Each midterm is 15% of your grade, and your final exam is 20% of your grade. As stated in the syllabus, if your final exam score is better than your worst midterm score, your worst midterm score will be dropped and replaced with the final.

Q: Are the exams proctored?
: A: Yes, the exams are proctored through the Computer-Based Testing Facility. It is your responsibility to register for the appropriate exam before the test date and check-in on time for testing. For each exam, please make sure you properly set up your workspace in accordance with CBTF instructions.

Q: How does the CBTF proctoring work?
: A: You must register for an exam slot. You will receive emails reminding you to do so. Ten minutes before your exam slot, you are able to check-in. When you check-in, you will be given a Zoom link to sign onto. From there, you will follow the directions of your proctor.

Q: What do I do if I need a conflict exam?
: A: Submit a request for a conflict exam through the CBTF website with rationale as to why. You will not be able to register for a conflict exam time until your request is approved.

Q: What should I do if I have DRES accommodations?
: A: Please email Albert with the necessary information. To reiterate, please include [STAT 400] in your subject line.

Q: How will we access the exam?
: A: The exam will be available to you after you check-in through the CBTF website. The exam will be a pdf available on Box.

Q: Why can’t I log into Box?
: A: Please make sure you have Box access enabled through the UIUC Cloud Dashboard. We highly recommend that you test your Box login prior to the exam time.

Q: What materials are allowed for the exam?
: A: You are allowed pencils/pens, paper, your cheat sheet (one sheet, two pages, front and back), and a calculator that does not access the internet. You will not have access to R or Discord during the exam.

Q: WIll I have access to the distribution tables?
: A: For exams that require t-distribution, normal distribution, and/or chi-squared distribution tables, they will be provided for you in the exam.

Q: Can I print out the exam?
: A: Absolutely. You can print out the exam to work on it during your test period.

Q: Can I use an electronic tablet?
: A: The CBTF does not allow electronic tablets. You must use the archaic pencil/pen and paper like the rest of us.

Q: Can I eat/drink during the exam?
: A: Food and drinks are allowed during testing.

Q: How will we submit the exam?
: A: You will submit your exam through Gradescope, just as if you were submitting your homework. You must scan/photograph each exam answer you are submitting and assign it to the appropriate question. Please make sure your work is legible and properly lit to make it easier for our graders.

Q: Can I use Discord to message Albert during the exam if I have questions?
: A: You are not allowed to use Discord during the exam. If you are confused about an exam problem, please complete the question to the best of your ability and ask Albert in a direct message through Discord after you have submitted.

Q: How much time do we have to complete the exam?
: A: You will have 80 minutes to complete the midterms and 170 minutes to complete the final exam. You then have 20 minutes to properly submit your exam to Gradescope. (e.g. 7:00-8:20PM to complete the exam and 8:20-8:40PM to submit).

Q: What do I do if Gradescope will not let me submit?
: A: Please convert your exam work to a pdf and email it to Albert with an explanation of the issue. As long as your email’s timestamp meets the deadline for Gradescope submission, you will not be penalized.

Q: What do I do if I disagree with my exam grade?
: A: You may submit a regrade request through Gradescope. Through the request, you must explain/make your case as to why you believe the grading is an inaccurate representation of your work. You have one week after the posting of the grades to send in a regrade request. After that week, your grade for that exam will be finalized. Please refrain from disputing feedback on the public Discord server.

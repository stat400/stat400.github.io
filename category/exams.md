Q: What do I do if I disagree with my exam grade?
: A: You may submit a regrade request through [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/). Through this request, you must explain/make your case as to why you believe the grading is an inaccurate representation of your work. You have one week after the posting of the grades to send in a regrade request. After that week, your grade for that exam will be finalized. Please refrain from disputing feedback on the public Discord server.

Hi, I'm Chris. I'm a first year PhD student in statistics. I'm not sure about my research area yet, but I'd like to do something in machine learning. I think my favorite topic from STAT 400 is computing probabilities from bivariate distributions. The calculus is pretty fun. As for hobbies, I like playing Smash, League, and tennis. I guess a fun fact about myself is that I don't really like watching anime. I much prefer to read manga. I haven't really been to campus, so I have no idea where to study. If you could give me some suggestions, that would be nice. Good luck with the class! Feel free to message me on Discord anytime. 

### David Kim

Hello, my name is David Kim. I'm from South Korea and this is my first year as a PhD student in the Department of Statistics. I do not have a concrete research area yet, but I have a broad interest on network analysis and probability theory. My favorite topic in this course is point estimation, particularly finding Maximum Likelihood Estimators! My favorite place to study on campus is Tech Plaza and Illini Union. My hobbies are running and watching baseball. My undergraduate major was Political Science - so I understand how some topics of STAT400 could be unfamilar if you are from other department. If you have any trouble in the class please visit my office hour! We can talk about it together. Hope you have a great semester! 

### David Lundquist

Hi I'm David Lundquist, not to be confused with David Kim. I'm a second-year PhD student, and I particularly like econometrics and sports analytics. You can often find me jogging through Champaign-Urbana or biking to school, sun or snow.  My favorite STAT-400 topics are conditional probability, discrete random variables, infinite series, and anything involving combinatorics.  Please ask me anything about statistics, especially if it involves financial applications or sports.

I’m Jaideep, a first year PhD student in the Statistics department. As I am a first year student, I haven’t really decided on a research topic yet! My favorite topics for this course would be point estimation and confidence intervals. Sadly, I haven’t really been on campus yet, so I don’t have any place that I like. I enjoy watching anime and k-dramas. I spend most of my time playing Valorant and Rocket League, that is if I am not watching anime or studying. Feel free to message me anytime! Have a good semester.

I am Tianning Xu, a third-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics. My research interests lie in sequential decision making under uncertainty and statistical inference for ensemble models. For this course, I like the Maximum Likelihood Estimator best. You will soon find it surprisingly useful in many applications of statistical inference and learning. In my leisure time, I like photography, but such activities are suspended due to Covid-19. Also, I enjoy games and some light workouts with my Switch. STAT 400 might be your first or second exposure to statistics; I hope that you enjoy this course and that it can give you full confidence to explore more advanced statistics courses of your own interests.

### Benny Zhao

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stat400/stat400.github.io/main/PDFs/bio_photos/benny_zhao.png" alt="Benny Zhao" style="width:200px;">

Hi, my name is Benny, and I'm a second-year Mathematics student in the College of Liberal Arts & Sciences. My favorite topic covered in STAT 400 is bivariate distributions. My favorite place to study on campus pre-Covid is the ACES Library, since it was usually quiet and it wasn't too far from where I had lived on campus. In my free time, I enjoy listening to music. A fun fact about myself is that I particularly enjoy listening to music from video game soundtracks. I wish you a great semester, and hopefully some fun in learning.

### Evan Ripperger

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stat400/stat400.github.io/main/PDFs/bio_photos/evan_ripperger.jpg" alt="Evan Ripperger" style="width:200px;">

Hello! My name is Evan, and I am a senior mechanical engineering student here at the university. I took statistics during my junior year and really loved solving problems with bivariate distributions. The most interesting word problems come from that topic and it is a joy to solve problems by drawing a little picture instead of writing countless lines of math. Before Covid hit my favorite place to study was in the MEB on the second floor. Even before the virus, not a lot of people visit that building to study, so I enjoyed the quietness and open space. When I am not doing schoolwork, I try to spend time with friends. I enjoy cooking, playing video games, and listening to music. A fun fact about me is that I take care of 12 different plants around my apartment. The oldest plant is an aloe vera I got in middle school and the youngest is a monstera deliciosa that sprouted just two weeks ago! I am excited to be a grader this semester and would be happy to help in any way I can. Reach out to me via discord or email and I can answer any questions I receive. Thanks for reading my bio!

### Michelle Shen

Hey, friends. I’m Michelle, a sophomore studying Finance in the Gies College of Business with minors in Applied Statistics and Computer Science. Despite this being my first semester as a STAT 400 Course Assistant, I already consider myself the best woman on the team. My favorite topics are Confidence Intervals and Hypothesis Testing. Prior to the pandemic, I would be in the Business Instructional Facility 24/7. In my free time, I play Hades, drink room temperature water, and listen to Carly Rae Jepsen’s entire discography while I camp the STAT 400 Discord server. A fun fact about me is that I absolutely love music, and I was in Chamber Choir for all four years of high school. Reach out anytime about anything; I look forward to getting to know you all!

### Sagar Katiyar

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stat400/stat400.github.io/main/PDFs/bio_photos/sagar_katiyar.png" alt="Sagar Katiyar" style="width:200px;">

Hi! My name is Sagar and I am a senior majoring in Electrical Engineering and minoring in Statistics and Computer Science. I took STAT 400 in Spring 2020 and had the most fun doing Hypothesis Testing. My favorite place to study on campus is the break room in the Illini Union basement. As for hobbies, I have quite a few. I enjoy playing the guitar, piano and drums, scuba diving, and sometimes painting during my free time. A fun fact about myself: Despite being a lazy sloth by nature, whenever something new intrigues me, I waste no time in trying to learn about it. As such, I’ve acquired a rather weird skillset. STAT 400 is a really fun course so the best way to succeed in it is to start your homework early, ask questions and simply keep your eyes open. Looking forward to getting to know all of you over this semester. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions, academic or otherwise. Good luck!

I’m Jaideep, a first year PhD student in the Statistics department. As I am a first year student, I haven’t really decided on a research topic yet! My favorite topics for this course would be point estimation and confidence intervals. Sadly, I haven’t really been on campus yet, so I don’t have any place that I like. I enjoy watching anime and k-dramas. I spend most of my time playing Valorant and Rocket League, that is if I am not watching anime or studying. Feel free to message me anytime! Have a good semester.

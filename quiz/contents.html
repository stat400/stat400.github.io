    <h3>General Probability</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Basic dice rolling, 52-card deck drawing, etc.</li>
        <li>Simple discrete distribution probability (e.g., binomial, negative binomial, geometric, multinomial, hypergeometric probability)</li>
        <li>Conditional Probability & Bayes' Theorem</li>
        <li>Law of Total Probability</li>
        <li>A few more interesting/challenging probability questions</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>General Guidelines</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You may either give an exact answer (the relative tolerance is 1e-5), or round to 4 decimal places. <i>Fractions</i> (not <i>expressions</i>) are accepted. These are largely the same guidelines for homework and exams. (We may be more generous on HW and exams.)</li>
        <li>The solutions tab will often not contain the numerical solution, or even many numbers at all. It instead guides you to find the answer. In either case, it should be used as a last resort.</li>
        <li>If you believe there is a mistake with any question or solution, please bring it up in the Discord server.</li>
        <li>Using calculators and/or R, and discussing questions with others are all permitted (and even encouraged!). On the other hand, be wary of chatbot use ‚Äî it might lead you in the right direction, but will give you the incorrect answer the vast majority of the time.</li>
        <li>Questions marked with a gold star (‚≠ê) are more challenging. You likely do not have to know how to solve them in order to succeed in this course üòé</li>
        <li>Unless stated otherwise, all n-sided dice are fair and contain the integers 1 to n, inclusive, on their faces.</li>
        <li>If not explicitly stated and there is no information to the contrary, random variables that appear in the same question are independent.</li>
    </ul>
